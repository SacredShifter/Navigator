# Sacred Shifter Module Recommendation System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Guide Cursor AI and Sacred Shifter system in recommending appropriate healing modules based on Navigator profile results

---

## 🎯 Overview

After a user completes the Navigator assessment, they receive a **consciousness profile** that determines which Sacred Shifter modules and experiences will best support them. This document details the recommendation logic for Cursor AI to implement.

### Core Recommendation Principles

1. **Safety First** - Never recommend experiences beyond user's nervous system capacity
2. **Chemical State Awareness** - Adjust recommendations based on substance/medication use
3. **Regulation Matching** - Match intensity to current regulation level
4. **Profile Alignment** - Honor the user's archetypal consciousness state
5. **Progressive Deepening** - Start gentle, increase challenge as capacity builds

## 📊 Profile-Based Recommendations

### 1. Numb Profile

**Essence:** Disconnection, dissociation, numbness, shutdown, protective freeze response

**Primary Goal:** Re-sensitization, gentle awakening of feeling capacity

#### Recommended Modules (Priority Order)

| Module | Why | Pacing | Safety Notes |
|--------|-----|--------|--------------|
| **Body Scan** | Gentle somatic awareness, no emotional demand | Very Slow | Start with extremities, avoid trauma hotspots |
| **Breath Guide** | Basic nervous system re-engagement | Very Slow | Simple patterns only (box breath, 4-7-8) |
| **Tiny Actions** | Build agency through micro-wins | Very Slow | Celebrate every completion |
| **Grounding Protocol** | Reality anchoring, safety building | Slow | Physical grounding (feet on floor, cool water) |
| **Regulation Track** | Co-regulation, pacing restoration | Slow | Therapist-assisted preferred |

#### Avoid These Modules

- ❌ Deep emotional processing (too much, too fast)
- ❌ Psychedelic integration content (requires felt sense)
- ❌ High-intensity somatic work (can re-traumatize)
- ❌ Leadership/service content (premature; foundation needed first)

#### Cursor AI Prompts for Numb Profile

```
"I notice you're in a Numb state right now. That makes complete sense -
sometimes our system needs to shut down to protect us. Let's start very gently.

I'm recommending:
1. Body Scan - Just 5 minutes of noticing your body exists
2. Breath awareness - No pressure, just curiosity

We'll build from here. There's no rush."
```

---

### 2. Lost Profile

**Essence:** Disorientation, trauma overwhelm, seeking safety, need for support and structure

**Primary Goal:** Establish safety, provide orientation, gentle stabilization

#### Recommended Modules (Priority Order)

| Module | Why | Pacing | Safety Notes |
|--------|-----|--------|--------------|
| **Trauma Safety Track** | Explicit trauma-informed guidance | Very Slow | Crisis resources always visible |
| **Grounding Protocol** | Reality anchoring, present-moment focus | Very Slow | Physical grounding emphasized |
| **Safety Overlay** | Continuous safety monitoring | Always On | Auto-activates for Lost profile |
| **Recovery Track** (if substance involved) | Stabilization, medical support | Very Slow | Encourage professional support |
| **Body Scan** | Gentle embodiment, no overwhelm | Very Slow | Permission to pause anytime |

#### Avoid These Modules

- ❌ Awakening content (destabilizing when already overwhelmed)
- ❌ Integration work (need safety foundation first)
- ❌ High-challenge experiences (retraumatizing risk)
- ❌ Psychedelic content (contraindicated)

#### Chemical State Overrides for Lost Profile

- **Psychedelic:** Route to **Grounding Protocol** ONLY, maximum safety
- **Withdrawal:** Route to **Recovery Track**, medical support emphasis
- **Any:** Increase safety check frequency, make crisis resources prominent

#### Cursor AI Prompts for Lost Profile

```
"You're in a Lost state, which means your system is asking for safety and support.
That takes courage to acknowledge.

I want to connect you with our Trauma Safety Track. This is designed specifically
for times like this - it moves slowly, checks in frequently, and gives you complete
control.

Crisis support is available 24/7 if you need it: [crisis line numbers]

Would you like to begin?"
```

### 3. Seeker Profile

**Essence:** Truth-seeking, curiosity, questioning, openness, exploring identity and meaning

**Primary Goal:** Support authentic exploration, provide clarity tools, honor questions

#### Recommended Modules (Priority Order)

| Module | Why | Pacing | Safety Notes |
|--------|-----|--------|--------------|
| **Awakening Track** | Supports consciousness expansion | Medium | Stabilization emphasis |

| **Integration Practices** | Process insights, anchor learnings | Medium | Reflection prompts included |
| **Grounding Protocol** (if psychedelic) | Reality anchoring during expansion | Slow | Frequent safety checks |
| **Body Scan** | Embodiment of insights | Medium | Connect concepts to felt sense |

#### Avoid These Modules

- ⚠️ Leadership content (if not ready for service orientation)
- ⚠️ Advanced psychedelic integration (unless experienced)

#### Chemical State Adaptations for Seeker Profile

- **Sober:** Full access to Awakening Track, encourage reflection
- **Psychedelic:** Route to **Grounding Protocol** first, then gentle awakening content
- **Withdrawal:** Route to **Recovery Track** for stabilization
- **Prescription meds:** Lower stimulation, acknowledge medication support

#### Cursor AI Prompts for Seeker Profile

```
"You're in a Seeker state - your consciousness is asking questions and
looking for truth. Beautiful.

I'm recommending our Awakening Track, which is designed to support authentic
exploration while keeping you grounded and safe.

This isn't about giving you answers - it's about holding space for your questions.
Ready to explore?"
```

## 🔐 Safety Override Matrix

Certain profile + chemical state combinations require **mandatory safety overrides**:

| Profile | Chemical State | Override Action | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Lost** | Any | → Trauma Safety Track | Core trauma present |
| **Lost** | Psychedelic | → Grounding Protocol ONLY | High crisis risk |
| **Lost** | Withdrawal | → Recovery Track | Medical stabilization needed |
| **Awakening** | Psychedelic | → Grounding Protocol | Reality anchoring critical |
| **Awakening** | Withdrawal | → Recovery Track | Stabilize before awakening work |
| **Any** | Withdrawal + Low Regulation | → Recovery Track | Medical priority |
| **Numb** | Psychedelic | → Gentle Grounding | Can't integrate without felt sense |
| **Expander** | Stimulant | Moderate all intensity | Mania/burnout risk |

### Safety Gate Implementation

```typescript
function applySafetyOverrides(
  profile: NavigatorProfile,
  chemicalState: ChemicalState,
  regulationLevel: RegulationLevel
): { recommendedTrack: string; reason: string } {

  // Lost + any psychedelic = immediate grounding
  if (profile.name === 'Lost' && chemicalState === 'psychedelic') {
    return {
      recommendedTrack: 'grounding-protocol',
      reason: 'You\'re in a vulnerable state while experiencing altered consciousness. Let\'s prioritize grounding and safety first.'
    };
  }

  // Any profile + withdrawal + low regulation = recovery
  if (chemicalState === 'withdrawal' && regulationLevel === 'low') {
    return {
      recommendedTrack: 'recovery-track',
      reason: 'Your nervous system needs stabilization support right now. Let\'s focus on recovery first.'
    };
  }

  // Awakening + psychedelic = grounding priority
  if (profile.name === 'Awakening' && chemicalState === 'psychedelic') {
    return {
      recommendedTrack: 'grounding-protocol',
      reason: 'Your consciousness is expanding. Let\'s make sure you stay anchored and oriented.'
    };
  }

  // Continue for all override scenarios...
}
```

## 🔄 Reassessment Triggers

Recommend Navigator reassessment when:

1. **30+ days since last assessment** (natural state shifts)
2. **Major life event** (user reports change)
3. **Chemical state change** (started/stopped substances)
4. **User expresses misalignment** ("This doesn't feel right")
5. **Safety concerns arise** (repeated distress signals)
6. **Profile completion** (e.g., Integrator completes integration, ready to expand)

### Cursor AI Reassessment Prompt

```
"I notice it's been [X weeks] since your last Navigator assessment.
Things may have shifted for you - that's natural.

Would you like to retake the assessment? It only takes 5-7 minutes,
and it helps us make sure we're recommending experiences that truly
serve where you are *now*.

You can also explore without reassessing - your choice entirely."
```
